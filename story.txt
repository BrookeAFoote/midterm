Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of ninja students.
Kai-Yun liked craft beer and playing banjo.
the ninja students were not very skilled.
They could fling but not ninja stars.
On day Kai-Yun and the ninja students went out for a walk.
and they noticed an intruder entered into the mystical land of Shangrila.
the intruder slaughtered them all, no one morned them.
