Once upon a time in the mystical land of Detroit there dwelt an immortal named David and his trusty band of ninja students.
David liked craft beer and playing banjo.
the ninja students were not very skilled.
They could fling but not ninja stars.
One day David and the ninja students went out for a walk.
and they noticed an intruder entered into the mystical land of Detroit.
the intruder slaughtered them all, no one morned them.
